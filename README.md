# GTA-V-Default-Handling-Files---FiveM-resource
A copy of the default handling.meta files found in GTA V. Saved for future reference and set up as a FiveM resource.

To use drop the 'handling' folder into your resources folder and add `start handling` to your server.cfg file.

The Unified-handling.meta file is there to combine all wheeled vehicles together into one file for my own use, this is in alphabetical order and with common formatting as R* should have done in the first place.
